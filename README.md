# Miami-Dade COVID19 Case Study
Scripts used to wrangle and plot COVID-19 testing, hospitalisation, deaths, and death delay data for Miami-Dade County in Florida


## Figure 1: Testing and Cases
The figure showing number of COVID-19 tests and their proportion positive is built with the script `R/pub_plot_prop_tests_20200915.R`.


## Figure 2: Hospitalisations and Deaths
The figure showing number of COVID-19 hospitalisations, ICU use, ventilator use, and deaths is built with the script `R/pub_plot_hosp_deaths_20200915.R`.


## Figure 3: Delay in Deaths Reporting
The figure showing number of COVID-19 deaths by reporting period is built with the script `R/pub_plot_back2future_deaths_20201001.R`. We call it the "back to the future" plot because we "pretend" to have a time machine to see number of deaths that *will be* reported for a given day a few months in the future.
